  # unsetvars: because miab sets bash '-e' to fail any setup script

  # variables prior to running start.sh. Doing so will test that no
  # failures occur during setup in the most common use case because
  # other vagrant definitions in this file load
  # tests/system-setup/setup-default.sh, which pre-assign a value to
  # most variables.
