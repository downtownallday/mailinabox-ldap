| [7fa070a](https://github.com/downtownallday/mailinabox-ldap/commit/7fa070aed89684714a61475ba34cb3644d77fc91) | 2022-10-24 | _downtownallday_ | avoid using PYTHONPATH to enable setup mod hooks, which is problematic for managment command line tool use - save the directory path to setup mods in /etc/mailinabox.conf - dynamically add the path to python during hook initialization |
| [bb969f1](https://github.com/downtownallday/mailinabox-ldap/commit/bb969f16ae1733825a7a66212fc9dbf8c189548b) | 2022-10-24 | _downtownallday_ | avoid prematurely termination of the processing pool |
| [cac796a](https://github.com/downtownallday/mailinabox-ldap/commit/cac796a5bb32f686b06dae72271b91a5aecd3e95) | 2022-10-20 | _downtownallday_ | Enable compression for wget downloads. This fixes an issue where unless compression=auto (or compression=gzip) is specified, using wget to download jquery.min.js by setup/management.sh fails with max redirects exceeded. The man page says --compression is an experimental option, but it doesn't appear to have any problems. Note that downloading jquery.min.js with curl works fine when wget without --compression fails. |
